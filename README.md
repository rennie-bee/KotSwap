# Sensor and Face Swapping

## Introudction
There are two sections in the app:
- Users can test sensors including Magnetic, Proximity, Light, Step Counter, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Pressure.
- Users can upload two facial images and achieve a face swapping trick.

## Time Cost
About 16 hours in total.

## Challenging Work
The second feature is relatively harder to implement: We have to integrate Face Detection ML Kit APIs or any other Open source Library.
